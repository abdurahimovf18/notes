PyStarterKit is a `starter-kit` or a `template` for python that includes:
1. Well applied Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design (DDD) 
2. Already connected batteries such as `PostreSQL`, `Redis` and `RabbitMQ`.
3. Fully integrated CI via `GitHub Actions`
4. Isolated Tests and Development Environments
5. Documentation, written for the core structure of the project.
6. And more...
